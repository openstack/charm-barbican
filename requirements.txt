# This file is managed centrally by release-tools and should not be modified

#
# NOTE(lourot): This might look like a duplication of test-requirements.txt but
# some tox targets use only test-requirements.txt whereas charm-build uses only
# requirements.txt

# NOTE: newer versions of cryptography require a Rust compiler to build,
